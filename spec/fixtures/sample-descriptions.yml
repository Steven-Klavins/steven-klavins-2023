  heading: Full-Stack Engineer with over 2 years of industry experience, Makers Academy alumnus,
    and university graduate holding a BA in Digital Arts and Technology.

  languages_proficient_in: Ruby and Javascript form a significant part of my industry experience. I have utilized both
    languages extensively in developing responsive JS interfaces and Rails applications.
    Further, while attending Makers Academy, I immersed myself in the study and practical application of both
    languages, exploring a variety of use cases and frameworks.

  languages_familiar_with: I am familiar with several languages, both in and outside of a commercial setting, and
    I continuously strive to expand my vocabulary. I have commercial experience using Python and Java. Specifically,
    I have contributed to the development and maintenance of a flagship Java application, as well as a number of Sphinx
    sites. Furthermore, I have also become familiar with C++ through game development and my ongoing exploration into
    the world of microcontrollers.

  technologies_proficient_in: My experience with Ruby on Rails spans more than 3 years. During my time at Amphora
    Research Systems I successfully upgraded, maintained, and developed multiple commercial projects, further
    deepening my knowledge of the Rails ecosystem. As a result, I have gained a competent grasp of the framework
    and its intricacies.

  technologies_familiar_with: I am familiar with a variety of technologies, including Docker, Spring MVC, Flask,
    Node, and React, among many others. My work ethic is fueled by curiosity, which drives me to continually
    broaden my knowledge and skill set. I find the journey of learning new skills to be deeply enriching, and I
    always approach it with enthusiasm.

  areas_of_interest_software: My primary skill set is in programming and I have studied it avidly since 2019.
    I independently taught myself OOP principles, attended Makers Academy and joined the industry in early
    2021. I'm continually broadening my knowledge and in the past year I have successfully completed six
    online development courses totaling over 250 hours of lecture time.

  areas_of_interest_cad: Having pursued a degree with a strong focus on 3D design, I found myself inevitably
    drawn into the captivating world of 3D printing and parametric modeling. It is difficult to put into words
    the overwhelming sense of empowerment I have felt while witnessing the ever-increasing accessibility of
    additive and subtractive manufacturing. This accessibility has opened up avenues for me to explore the
    practical applications of mechanical engineering and kinematics in ways I never anticipated.

  areas_of_interest_electrical: In early 2020, my fascination with the potential uses of microcontrollers prompted
    me to dive into the world of electronics. This pursuit led me to dedicate my spare time to studying this field,
    with the ultimate aim of bridging my knowledge between software and hardware. I remain immersed in this field,
    continually striving to reach a level of expertise where I can confidently develop my own PCBs from the ground up.

About:
  background_p1: Hello, I'm Steven, a 29-year-old Software Engineer residing in London, UK. Alongside my passion for
    tech and engineering, I also have a wide range of interests. I am a musician, a self-proclaimed horror movie nerd,
    and I find enjoyment in watching documentaries and animated films. While I'm not particularly enthusiastic about
    sports, I have always had a deep love for swimming and even had the opportunity to volunteer as a swimming teacher
    in the past.

  background_p2: Some might describe me as a quirky individual, as I fully embrace alternative culture and have a
    affinity for Gothic fashion and Prog-Metal. In terms of my musical abilities, I play multiple instruments, including
    guitar, bass, and I dabble with the piano. When inspiration strikes, I find enjoyment in composing music. Over the
    past decade, I've had the privilege of playing live in numerous venues across London and have been part of various
    projects.

  education_p1: I hold a Bachelor's degree in Digital Arts from Kingston University and successfully graduated from
    Makers Academy, London's leading coding bootcamp in 2020. Additionally, I have a foundation award in Graphics,
    an A level in design and technology and an A level in media studies achieving double distinction (A+). I also
    possess a certificate of achievement from Coventry University. This was obtained during my ISO 27001 training
    at Amphora Research Systems.

  education_p2: As part of a continuous effort to further my skill-sets I continue to study a range of topics in my own
    time. I have taken 6 online courses focused around development and engineering in the past year alone.

  hobbies_p1: As mentioned earlier, I have a deep passion for music and thoroughly enjoy both attending concerts and
    performing whenever I get the chance. Photography is another interest of mine, and I often find myself with a camera
    in hand. Throughout my journeys, I have been fortunate enough to capture breathtaking landscapes and photograph some
    of my favorite musicians.

  hobbies_p2: I have an insatiable passion for thrills, particularly when it comes to rollercoasters and fair rides.
    Every visit to a theme park is an adventure I wholeheartedly embrace. As a devoted horror movie buff, I find
    great enjoyment in experiencing the exhilaration of a good scare. However, my interests extend beyond
    fear-inducing tales, as I am equally enthralled by the world of animation and documentaries.

  hobbies_p3: Engineering, in all its diverse forms, has a captivating hold on me, driving my curiosity to explore
    various disciplines within this field. I actively study and delve into the depths of engineering knowledge.
    Putting my newly acquired insights to practical use, I engage in activities like 3D printing and circuit
    building, continuously pushing the boundaries of my understanding through experimentation.
